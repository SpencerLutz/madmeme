## Description
Our website prompts a user to create a sentence with blanks. We fill these blanks with random words, put them on random memes, and display options for the user. The user can save their favorites in a database and get a permalink to view later or share with friends.

## APIs
We use API Ninja's [Random Word API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword) to get words to fill in and imgflip's [meme generator API](https://imgflip.com/api) to create the memes.
