Description
Our website prompts a user to create a sentence with blanks. We fill these blanks with random words, put them on random images, and display options for the user. The user can save their favorites in a database and get a permalink to view later or share with friends.

APIs
We use API Ninja's Random Word API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword) to get words to fill in and imgflip's meme generator API (https://imgflip.com/api) to create the memes.
