Description
Our website prompts a user to create a sentence with blanks. We fill these blanks with random words, put them on random images, and display options for the user. The user can save their favorites in a database and get a permalink to view later or share with friends.

APIs
We use API Ninja's Random Word API to get words to fill in and imgflip's meme generator API to create the memes.
